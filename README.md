The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

You wonâ€™t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed by:

    A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
    A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
    A database or files that store data (data = objects)
    An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
